# TravelInfo
Travel Information and Photoframe project for Windows IOT

C# project designed for a Raspberry Pi running Windows IOT with the official Raspberry Pi foundation screen. Connects to both National Rail and TFL datafeeds to get train times and Tube status information. This could be used as the basis of your own project as the stations and tube lines are hardcodes for my local stations. Requires your own account on both the National Rail datafeed and the TFL datafeed to get the information. As there is a mmonthly limit to the number of calls that can be made to National Rail, the code will only fetch the data for a set time period in the morning. It acts as a photoframe when not displaying train times. The photos reside on my server and a phot server is included in the project. Again this is hard coded for my use, but could easily be changed to provide photos from your own source.
